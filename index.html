    <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
    <p>Hi,

 

      My name is Th√©o Lemray, i'm nearly 19 years old, i'm from France and i started to produce music 3 years ago. <br>
      <br>
      I started to make electronic music (with a real project behind) 1 years ago. Before, i was trying to learn how to make music properly and i started all that because of all this inspiration of moody good, Culprate, Skrillex, Getter, Oshi, lorn and many more. I always trying to make music because i was literally born with it, my father and my uncle gave me this passion for electronic music by some Deadmau5, Benny Bennasi, Daft Punk, Laurent Garnier to quote some of them. <br>
      <br>
      I taked some drums courses, i play piano (i want learn it properly), a little bit of guitar but drums and piano are still the best instruments i know <br>
      <br>
      Now, what's about my project "ill us". First, the signification is "make us sick" in a bad English and all the universe of this project is based on the minimalism, mystery and paradox between two extremes. The whole project is not just music but art, i will go to a art school next year in the graphic design division and i have in mind to let grow the project in : <br>
      <br>
      
       
      
      - Music <br>
      
       <br>
      
      - Photos <br>
      
       <br>
      
      - Videos <br>
      
       <br>
      
      - Textile (some collaboration for this part) <br>
      
       <br>
      
      - And design in general (some collaborations for this part too) <br>
      
       <br>
      
      My purpose is to make this project growing up and try to lead all these projects in a good way, with good people and help people as i can when i will be able to do it properly. I always wanted to be creative, different and the fact that we can be creative on all the plans that we want is a real challenge but a great thing for me ! i got my real vision of my project, all in my head. For example i got in mind to do all my merchandising by collaborations because for me, it's always better to get the best of both world (my best part of my universe/designs/ideas, and all the expertise/ideas of the brands that will put all merchandising in the "best" level), but it's just to give you an idea of what kind of details i see for my creations, i love details and the fact that all is made for you and not a consumer and i got exactly the same vision for my music and all these art stuff. I don't make music for everyone, but for people who love and will love what i make in the d day. It‚Äôs like a live performance, if you come to see someone in live, you want to hear his set and be in his universe. that‚Äôs why i would be implicated in my visuals and stuff, that‚Äôs mean so much for me it‚Äôs like the second part of the music and if the visuals or the scene itself don‚Äôt feet the track, there is something missing. as i said i really like the importance of the details. <br>
      
      
      I did a remix for basecamp and a collaboration with astre (he‚Äôs a friend of me that will release a ep in moving castle !) <br>
      <br>
       My profile in live would be the two ‚Äúsides‚Äù of the scene (dj tools and live sets eventually) because i always love to be in the two ‚Äúsides‚Äù of the scene <br>
      <br>
       
      
      But the question is, why i want to work with shailee and your team ? First, Shailee came to me as a a&r from Owsla and she wanted to learn more about me and my music. she was really powerful when it was to talk about me to other people and i started to know more about her and for me, that kind of good feeling is important. The plan in a music career would be to get in touch with other artists, get contracts, releases, articles in blogs and i know that Shailee is good at this ! then i learned more about c3 management and i was impressed by all the stuff that the team have made and it gives me a good feeling about the c3 team ! <br>
      
      <br>
      
      To conclude, i'm really new in this industry so if you got some suggestions about what we can do and all that stuff, it would be a pleasure to know more and learn more ! <br>
      
       <br>
      
      Have a good day, Ill us.
